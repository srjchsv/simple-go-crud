# simple-go-crud project

I tried to follow the standartized GO project structure.
Used Dockerfile for GO and docker-compose to be able to use SQL database, for building a simple CRUD web app.

### to build and run: 
 ``` docker compose up ```

### frontend will be available on:
http://localhost:8080/

p.s
I followed that awesome blog post while building that project:
